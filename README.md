# Project Description
The goal of this project is to use javascript to interact with the user so that they can take a quiz about various coding questions. The quiz gives a score based on the time taken, and questions gotten wrong. There is another page that retains all the highscores of people who have taken the quiz. 

# What the Website Looks Like
