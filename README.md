# Project Description
The goal of this project is to use javascript to interact with the user so that they can take a quiz about various coding questions. The quiz gives a score based on the time taken, and questions gotten wrong. There is another page that retains all the highscores of people who have taken the quiz that is viewed after completing the quiz. 

# What the Website Looks Like
